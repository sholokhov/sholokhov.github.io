### About

Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I am Artem - a SWE based in Amsterdam, who loves simple, fast and correct code, cutting-edge technology, 
[books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51112405-artem-sholokhov), music and sports. Iâ€™m a huge fan of functional 
programming and distributed systems, so I hope to dedicate some posts to these topics here.

I'm a Director of Engineering at [XITE](https://xite.com/) working on a personalized music television service, where I'm busy 
with building a synergy between engineering teams, designing and developing core backend platform, cloud infrastructure and many 
other exciting things!

Throughout my career I have been writing and storing notes for myself about various aspects of software development, so 
I hope I can structure and share some of them here at some point.
